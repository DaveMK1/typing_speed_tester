## Project Overview
The Typing Speed Tester is a simple web application designed to help users test their typing speed and accuracy. It presents users with a sentence to type and calculates their words per minute (WPM) and accuracy based on their input. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is served using Node.js and Express.

## Features
- Displays a sentence for the user to type
- Measures typing speed in words per minute (WPM)
- Calculates typing accuracy
- User-friendly interface

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

## Inspiration and Story

This Typing Speed Tester was inspired by my personal journey to improve my typing efficiency. Over the years, I realized the importance of accurate and fast typing in both professional and personal contexts. This project allowed me to combine my passion for coding with a practical tool that can benefit others. 

The development journey has been both challenging and rewarding. One of the significant challenges I faced was ensuring the accuracy of the WPM and accuracy calculations. By implementing real-time input tracking and precise time measurement, I overcame this challenge and created a reliable typing speed tester.

## Future Plans

In the next iteration, I plan to:
- Add multiple sentences for variety
- Implement user authentication to track progress over time
- Enhance the UI for a more engaging user experience
